# Oinkster

This is a web app meant to offer the same basic functionality that Twitter does.

Currently the app's features include:
- A front end built with `React.js`/`Redux`
- A `Node.js/Express` RESTful API
- A `PostgreSQL` database
- Authentication with JSON web tokens

Before I deploy to app I would like to:
- Write tests with `mocha`, `chai`, `sinon`, `enzyme`, and `supertest`
- Finish styling
- Integrate image uploading with `AWS S3` buckets and the `AWS API`
- Implement "hashtag" and "following" features

Once I have this basic functionality working, I would like to:
- Analyze some of the data with natural language processing APIs
- Graph app data with `D3.js` or `chart.js`
- Integrate social authentication with `Auth0`
